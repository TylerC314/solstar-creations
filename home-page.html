        <p>SolStar Creations Drums lovingly honor the animals, trees, and parts used to create all drums. All work
            areas, tools and drum parts are smudged with sage prior to the drum being born. Each drum is meditated with
            to infuse it with the drummerâ€™s Energy and the guidance received from what Animal Spirit it carries.</p>
        <p>Every drum is signed, numbered and comes with care instructions.</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">If you would like a drum other than what is available, please contact me and I
            would be happy to give you a quote. Sizes available for special order are 15", 18", and 20". Special orders
            require payment when an order is placed. Please allow 4-6 weeks for custom orders to be delivered.</p>
